"""Generate a candidate change for one skill and produce the evidence a reviewer needs.

The candidate search (optimize.bestofn) turns the skill's components into a challenger on the train
tasks. Champion and challenger then run through the full agent with a local `route_and_load` on the
held-out tasks; each variant is a Langfuse dataset run (side-by-side in the UI) when the stack is
up. The result is a quarantined record in runs/pending/<skill>.json plus a portable evidence bundle
in runs/evidence/. Nothing here activates anything: promotion is a human action in the UI.

Usage: python -m optimize.ab <skill> [--description | --scripts] [--skip-search]
