# Skill sources

No skills are committed. Every source is pulled from upstream by `scripts/fetch_skills.sh` (clone,
copy skill dirs, delete the clone), so each stays under its own license. All are curated from the
[VoltAgent index](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-agent-skills):

| source arg | repo | skills | license |
|------------|------|--------|---------|
| `anthropics` | [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) | document skills (pdf, docx, pptx, xlsx, …) | per-skill (see frontmatter) |
| `nvidia` | [nvidia/skills](https://github.com/nvidia/skills) | GPU / infra / data / medical imaging | Apache-2.0 |
| `lambdatest` | [LambdaTest/agent-skills](https://github.com/LambdaTest/agent-skills) | testing frameworks (pytest, playwright, cypress, appium, …) | MIT |
| `trailofbits` | [trailofbits/skills](https://github.com/trailofbits/skills) | security analysis (semgrep, static analysis, vuln scanners, …) | CC-BY-SA-4.0 |

```bash
scripts/fetch_skills.sh all                    # everything above
scripts/fetch_skills.sh anthropics trailofbits # or pick sources
docker compose restart mcp                     # pick up the new skills
```

Fetching skips skills already present and caps large sources. Review each source's license before
redistributing.
